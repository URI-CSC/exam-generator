    - Consider an empty hash table of length $11$, in which keys $11,22,15,2,17,20,6,33$ are inserted with $h(x)=(x+3) \mod 11$ and separate chaining.  What is the total number of {\it collisions}?
    - Consider an empty hash table of length $11$, in which keys $17,22,1,32,23,41,9,28$ are inserted with $h(x)=(x+5) \mod 11$ and separate chaining.  What is the total number of {\it collisions}?
