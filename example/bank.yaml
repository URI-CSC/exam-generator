- question:
    - A post-order traversal of a {\it max-heap} with $15$ elements is $1,2,\dots,14,15$.  What is the sum of all keys in nodes of height $h=2$?
    - A post-order traversal of a {\it max-heap} with $7$ elements is $1,2,\dots,6,7$.  What is the sum of all keys in nodes of height $h=1$?

    - Consider an empty hash table of length $11$, in which keys $9,21,17,12,27,20,16,31$ are inserted with $h(x)=(x+7) \mod 11$ and separate chaining.  What is the total number of {\it collisions}?
